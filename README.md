## Cool Math

As a math enthusiast, I at times like to try out algorithms or lay down some ideas. This repository **(very much growing)** is a collection of some of those ideas.

### Table of Contents

- [Algorithming Sudoku](https://github.com/SepehrAkbari/Cool-Math/tree/main/Algorithming-Sudoku)

This directory includes python scripts that solve a sudoku puzzle using backtracking algorithm. I also included code that can be used for generating a sudoku puzzle, with different levels of difficulty (0-100).

- [DaysDate](https://github.com/SepehrAkbari/Cool-Math/tree/main/DaysDate)

This directory includes two notebooks containing two different algorithms for finding the day of the week of any given date in the Gregorian calendar.

- [Modeling an Egg](https://github.com/SepehrAkbari/Cool-Math/tree/main/Egg-Modeling)

This is a rather long project. It includes three different approaches to model a chicken egg, then using the model to calculate the volume and surface area of the egg.
